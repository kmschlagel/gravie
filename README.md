# Gravie Software Engineer Challenge
### Running this project

To start project, run the following: 
1. `npm install` (to install all necessary modules)
2. `ng serve --open` (using --open will automatically open in your browser)

### Beyond the time box

If there were more time to develop this app, I would do the following to improve user experience, performance, etc.

* Add error handling to any and all services
* Show message when search results in zero items
* Add other ways to search beyond title (genre, release date, etc.)
* Add pagination for large result sets
* Add ability to filter search results
* Add ability to sort search results based on preferences (alphabetically, newest to oldest, etc.)
* Include a cart icon that also increments number of items when new ones are added
* Add validation to prevent duplicate cart items
* Overall style and layout changes (I did as much as I could within the time box, but ultimately it could use more attention)
* Add ability to actually "rent" items
* Add ability to remove items from cart and/or clear cart

### General comments from Kate

I had a great time with this project! I enjoyed the challenges it provided and learned some new things in the process. I will be the first to admit that it's far from production ready, but I hope it gives you an indication of my overall approach and how this project could develop into a fully-formed application. 
Thanks for your consideration!
