# Gravie Software Engineer Challenge

## Instructions
After completing the challenge below, please send us an email with the location of your repository. If your repository is private, be sure to add us as collaborators so we can view your code.

### Time Box
3-4 Hours

## Synopsis

For this challenge you will implement the Giant Bomb API to create an application that will allow a user to search games and "rent" them. The application should consist of at least two unique pages (`search` and `checkout`). Your view should display the game thumbnail and title, and the rest is up to you. You can use any language and or framework you'd like.

### Questions

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. Remember we are more focused on seeing your development process than checking off a list of requirements, so be sure you are able to speak to your code and your thoughts behind it.


### Running this project

To start project, run the following: 
1. `npm install` (to install all necessary modules)
2. `ng serve --open` (using --open will automatically open in your browser)

### Beyond the time box

If there were more time to develop this app, I would do the following to improve user experience, performance, etc.

* Add error handling to any and all services
* Show message when search results in zero items
* Add other ways to search beyond title (genre, release date, etc.)
* Add pagination for large result sets
* Add ability to filter search results
* Add ability to sort search results based on preferences (alphabetically, newest to oldest, etc.)
* Include a cart icon that also increments number of items when new ones are added
* Add validation to prevent duplicate cart items
* Overall style and layout changes (I did as much as I could within the time box, but ultimately it could use more attention)
* Add ability to actually "rent" items
* Add ability to remove items from cart and/or clear cart

### General comments from Kate

I had a great time with this project! I enjoyed the challenges it provided and learned some new things in the process. I will be the first to admit that it's far from production ready, but I hope it gives you an indication of my overall approach and how this project could develop into a fully-formed application. 
Thanks for your consideration!
